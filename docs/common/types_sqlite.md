# Types

SQLDelight column definitions are identical to regular SQLite column definitions but support an [extra column constraint](custom_column_types.md)
which specifies the Kotlin type of the column in the generated interface. SQLDelight natively supports Long, Double, String, ByteArray, Int, Short, Float, and Booleans.

```sql
CREATE TABLE some_types (
  some_long INTEGER,           -- Stored as INTEGER in db, retrieved as Long
  some_double REAL,            -- Stored as REAL in db, retrieved as Double
  some_string TEXT,            -- Stored as TEXT in db, retrieved as String
  some_blob BLOB,              -- Stored as BLOB in db, retrieved as ByteArray
  some_int INTEGER AS Int,     -- Stored as INTEGER in db, retrieved as Int
  some_short INTEGER AS Short, -- Stored as INTEGER in db, retrieved as Short
  some_float REAL AS Float     -- Stored as REAL in db, retrieved as Float
);
```

Boolean columns are stored in the db as `INTEGER`, and so they can be given `INTEGER` column constraints. Use `DEFAULT 0` to default to false, for example.

```sql
CREATE TABLE hockey_player (
  injured INTEGER AS Boolean DEFAULT 0
)
```
