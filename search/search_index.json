It compile-time verifies your schema, statements, and migrations and provides IDE features like autocomplete and refactoring which make writing and maintaining SQL simple. SQLDelight currently supports the SQLite dialect and there are supported SQLite drivers on Android, JVM, iOS, and Windows. Example To use SQLDelight, apply the gradle plugin and put your SQL statements in a .sq file in src/main/sqldelight .
